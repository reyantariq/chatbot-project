Simple C++ Chatbot
This is a simple rule-based chatbot implemented in C++ that uses basic string matching to generate responses. The chatbot can interact with users, handle simple queries, and provide appropriate replies. It's a great starting point for anyone looking to explore Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts and chatbot development in C++.

Features:
Responds to common user inputs like "hello", "how are you", "what is your name", etc.

Case-insensitive input handling (e.g., "Hello" or "hello" are treated the same).

Simple rule-based chatbot logic based on predefined patterns.

Looping conversation until the user types 'quit' to exit the chat.

Project Structure:
